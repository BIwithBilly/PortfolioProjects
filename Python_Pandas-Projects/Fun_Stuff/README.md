# 🛠️ Fun Stuff: Python Automation & Utilities

This folder is a collection of "utility" scripts designed to solve everyday problems using Python. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply coding logic to automate manual tasks and create interactive tools.

## 📁 Projects in this Folder

### 1. Automatic File Sorter
**Goal:** Clean up cluttered directories by automatically moving files into categorized folders (Images, CSVs, Text files, etc.) based on their extensions.
* **Key Skills:** OS module integration, file path manipulation, and automated directory creation.
* **Problem Solved:** Saves time spent manually organizing downloads or project folders.

### 2. BMI Calculator
**Goal:** A simple interactive tool that takes user input (weight and height) and calculates Body Mass Index, providing a health category classification.
* **Key Skills:** User input handling, mathematical logic, and conditional (if-else) statements.
* **Problem Solved:** Demonstrates clean logic for interactive command-line tools.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:** `os`, `shutil` (for file management)

## 🚀 How to use these scripts
1. Navigate to the specific notebook you are interested in.
2. If running the **File Sorter**, ensure you update the `path` variable to a test folder on your local machine.
3. If running the **BMI Calculator**, simply execute the cells and follow the on-screen prompts for height and weight.
