# 📊 Paginated Reports Portfolio

This collection demonstrates my proficiency in **Power BI Report Builder** and **SSRS**, focusing on high-precision, print-ready reporting and complex data orchestration. Unlike standard dashboards, these reports are engineered for operational detail, multi-page formatting, and automated distribution.

## 🛠️ Technical Skillset Demonstrated

| Feature | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Orchestration** | Connected to **External SQL Sources** and **Power BI Datasets** using both Query and Report parameters. |
| **Advanced Logic** | Extensively used the **Expression Editor (`fx`)** for dynamic headers, footers, and complex business logic. |
| **Calculated Fields** | Created custom fields within the report layer to handle data transformations without altering the source. |
| **Interactivity** | Implemented **Document Maps**, **Drill-through actions**, and **Collapsible Groups** (as seen in the GIF). |
| **Visual Design** | Utilized Indicators, Sparklines, and Data Bars to provide "at-a-glance" insights within tabular formats. |
| **Conditional Formatting** | Applied expression-based color coding for performance KPIs and row highlighting. |
