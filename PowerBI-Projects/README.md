# Power BI Data Analytics Portfolio

This directory contains a collection of Power BI projects focused on transforming complex datasets into actionable business intelligence. Each project demonstrates end-to-end expertise in *Data Ingestion (Power Query)*, *Relational Modeling*, *Interactive UI/UX Design*, and *Enterprise-Grade Paginated Reporting*.

## 📂 Featured Projects

## 🏥 [HR Analytics Case Study: Atlas Labs](https://github.com/BIwithBilly/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/PowerBI-Projects/HR-CaseStudy)
*Focus: Talent Management & Attrition Analysis*

- **The Problem:** Atlas Labs needed to move from reactive human resources reporting to a proactive model that identifies attrition risks and demographic trends.
- **The Solution:** Developed a comprehensive HR dashboard tracking 1,470+ employees, featuring deep-dives into age demographics, gender parity, and pay equity. 
- **Key Tech:** Snowflake Schema Modeling, Power Query (Age Binning & FullName logic), and DAX (Attrition Rate & Active Headcount).

## 📄 [Paginated Reports Portfolio](./PaginatedReports)
*Focus: Operational Excellence & Print-Ready Reporting*
- **The Problem:** Dashboards are great for exploration, but businesses often need high-precision, multi-page documents for distribution or physical printing.
- **The Solution:** Developed a suite of RDL reports using **Power BI Report Builder** featuring cascading parameters, nested grouping, and conditional formatting.
- **Key Tech:** SQL/DAX Query Parameters, Expression Editor (`fx`), Document Maps, and Interactive Sorts.

## 📊 [Data Professional Survey Breakdown](./DataProfessionalSurveyBreakdown)
*Focus: Industry Trends & Salary Analysis*
- **The Problem:** Raw survey data from thousands of professionals was unorganized and inconsistent.
- **The Solution:** Cleaned 20+ columns of messy data and built a dynamic dashboard to visualize global salary trends and job satisfaction.
- **Key Tech:** Power Query (M), Salary Parsing, Dynamic Slicers, and Embedded Video Demos.

## 🏦 [US Bank Failures Analysis (2000 - Present)](./US_Failed_Banks)
*Focus: Risk Management & Economic Historical Trends*
- **The Problem:** Identifying patterns in banking instability over a 25-year period using messy FDIC data.
- **The Solution:** Developed a time-series dashboard featuring a "Play Axis" animation to track the geographical spread of bank closures.
- **Key Tech:** Star Schema Modeling, CALENDARAUTO() DAX, Play Axis Visuals, and Power Query standardization.
