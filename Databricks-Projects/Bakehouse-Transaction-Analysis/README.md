# Bakehouse Transaction Dashboard (Business Intelligence)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) tool using the **Databricks Lakehouse** platform. The focus was on engineering a dynamic user experience that allows stakeholders to filter massive datasets to find specific operational answers.

## Key Features
* **Multi-Dimensional Filtering:** Implemented Global Filters for `Payment Method` and `Quantity` to allow for real-time data drilling.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Designed the dashboard to show static "Global" metrics alongside dynamic "Filtered" metrics for immediate context.
* **Time-Series Visualization:** Developed logic to track transaction volumes over time, responding dynamically to user input.

## Data Source
Utilized the Databricks `Sales_Transactions` and `Product_Sales_Desc` sample datasets to model a retail "Bakehouse" environment.

## Portfolio Highlight
The included screenshot demonstrates the dashboard filtered for **Mastercard** transactions with a **Quantity of 20 or more**, showcasing the system's ability to isolate high-value wholesale-style orders from standard retail traffic.
